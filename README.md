[rp_author_review avatar="https://pillowspecialist.com/img/profile.webp" author="John Krauss" position="Obsessive Tester. Avid Dreamer"]I'm passionate about quality sleep, and I spent months testing pillows. I am reader-supported through purchases on Amazon. I hope my experience helps others.[/rp_author_review]

[rp_excerpt]A decent pillow - however, the issue is that if their one size & firmness level doesn't work for you, you're kind of stuck. The Dosaze Pillow offers free exchanges to different sizes and firmness levels so you can find the best fit for you, so I would test that one instead.[/rp_excerpt]
[rp_pros]Can reduce neck pain, Relatively lower cost[/rp_pros]
[rp_cons]foam was a bit too soft / low for me and I couldn't exchange it for a firmer or taller version, the cover sleeps pretty hot[/rp_cons]
